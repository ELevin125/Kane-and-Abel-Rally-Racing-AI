# Kane and Abel - Rally Racing AI

This project explores the integration of AI systems into a rally racing game environment. Two AI models were developed and compared: one based on pre-programmed behaviors and another utilising machine learning techniques. Along with the two AI systems, the project includes a custom car controller, 3 rally stages and a basic weather system for each.
